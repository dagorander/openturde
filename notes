UNTARING FILES
tar -xzvf $FILENAME
      x = extract
      z = using gzip
      v = verbose
      f = filename follows

PATCHING SOURCE
patch -p1 < name-of-diff
Then if things go wrong, manually apply the *.rej.*

SCRIPTING X11/CWM
xdotools (from packages) can probably do this
      see: https://www.semicomplete.com/projects/xdotool/

ksh array example:
      set -A myarray "a" "b" "c"

      for i in "${myarray[@]}"
      do
            echo $i
      done

Add the themes and copy-commands to a script
destination for themes is: /usr/local/share/themes/
Also figure out how to set correct DPI in Xresources for sane sizes of browsers and such.
