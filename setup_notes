Must activate doas first.
Just copy example file from /etc/examples to /etc
Set up networking:
ifconfig to find devices
to restart networking: # sh /etc/netstart
find hostname.xxxx files in /etc to config
see man iwx.4 for details on hostname file content.
Add git to be able to do things
clone openturde and run all the makes
install sxhkd picom and feh
install ranger
grabbing Turde for the wallpapers
Should update to default wallpaper that exists and add to OpenTurde
Remove Xconsole from xenodm config.
comment out xconsole genometry line in /etc/X11/xenodm/Xsetup_0?
we need to get the appropriate font that ST expects
fantasuqsansmono-nerd-fonts is in repos
need also normal fantasque-sans, figure out how to switch to nerd later
Install neovim and start on that
Install neofetch and maybe fastfetch
install htop, got screenfetch since fastfetch was not in repos
let's activate hyperthreading
rust might be just... pkg_add rust
install package 'node'
install yarn for lvim purposes
add curl because needs it
Actually curl was already there.
Copy /etc/examples/sysctl.conf to /etc and set hw.smt=1 to enable hyperthreading
then install helix
now it is time to get a persistent version of the openturde git repo
Time to change the PS1 to something useful
maybe this for prompt: https://www.reddit.com/r/openbsd/comments/7k3lh2/comment/drbfkpu/
basically, also needs to export ENV=/home/daniel/.kshrc in .profile?
That didn't seem to work?
. /etc/ksh.kshrc in .kshrc maybe to invoke the main one
nope
Testing: https://nanxiao.me/en/customize-ksh-display-for-openbsd/
nope
Trying this: https://www.reddit.com/r/openbsd/comments/wlyxw1/need_help_with_kshrc/
That worked!
Then to see what parts actually matter, but fine.
LunarVim install still no go, guess learning Helix?
Updated some things for hx in config
Switched dwm to use alacritty as terminal
for clangd language server, isntall clang-tools-extra
And then it just works
Find other language servers through hx --health
apmd might not be enabled by default! https://www.reddit.com/r/openbsd/comments/97bdog/apm_actions_dont_happen/
so doas rcctl enable apmd?
That seems to have made it go to auto at least. :D
switched editor to hx in ranger's rifle.conf
Mod Xenodm: https://www.tumfatig.net/2019/customizing-openbsd-xenodm/
That all lives in /etc/X11/xenodm/Xsetup_0
Remember to copy that file to repo
Installing Terminus because why not?
See: https://romanzolotarev.com/openbsd/xenodm.html
Was one more file, /etc/X11/xenodm/Xresources
Be very careful with that Xresources file... :D
installed bash language server with npm
not sure if it does anything though... doesn't seem to do much
