### BASICS

DWM: think hard about a sane keyboard shortcut setup


### USEABILITY

DWM: Cull unwanted layouts
ST: Figure out how to make scrolling work 
	preferably including "mouse scroll" with touchpad
	See the "scroll" binary from suckless then set in st config.h?
DWM: Get sticky tags set up - make it possible to make windows show on all tags temporarily
DWM: Set up a scratchpad terminal command - floating, middleish, should survive hiding
ST: Make files and directories look different in ls command


### PURDINESS

DWM: Add gaps - but only if there's more than one window
DWM: Patch for spacing over and under letters and such:
	https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/barpadding/
DWM: Look into better/alternative fonts
ST: Look into better/alternative fonts
DWM: Pick a different border colour
XENODM: Set a background - does that conflict with Background for DWM?
XENODM: Apply Nord theme colours to login dialogue
XENODM: Find Nord style puffy-fish image


### EXPANSIONS

DWM: Add more layouts


### LOW-PRIO BUGFIXES

SXHKD: Why are the monitor brightness keys not registering - not even in xev
RANGER: Understand what is needed to get image previews working - w3m is nope?
DWM: Understand why there are build warnings about negative unsigned values


### DEPRIORITISIED

RANGER: Figure out how to get image previews
OpenBSD: How to get zzz and ZZZ working?


### UNIMPORTANT NOTES

DWM: Alpha patch "alpha fixborders" makes terminal borders not inherit transp.
