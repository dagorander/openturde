### BASICS

DWM: think hard about a sane keyboard shortcut setup


### USEABILITY

DWM: Cull unwanted layouts
ST: Figure out how to make scrolling work - preferably including "mouse scroll" with touchpad
DWM: Get sticky tags set up - make it possible to make windows show on all tags temporarily
DWM: Set up a scratchpad terminal command - floating, middleish, should survive hiding


### PURDINESS

XSESSION: Use feh to set a wallpaper
DWM: Add gaps - but only if there's more than one window
ST: Set up Alpha patch
ST: See if ranger previews works with w3m - only without alpha patch?


### EXPANSIONS

DWM: Add more layouts
SLSTATUS: Figure out more about what can be done with it, like colors etc


### BUGFIXES

SXHKD: Why are the monitor brightness keys not registering - not even in xev
RANGER: Understand what is needed to get image previews working - w3m is nope?
