### BASICS

DWM: think hard about a sane keyboard shortcut setup


### USEABILITY

DWM: Cull unwanted layouts
ST: Figure out how to make scrolling work - preferably including "mouse scroll" with touchpad
DWM: Get sticky tags set up - make it possible to make windows show on all tags temporarily
DWM: Set up a scratchpad terminal command - floating, middleish, should survive hiding


### PURDINESS

DWM: Add gaps - but only if there's more than one window
ST: Set up Alpha patch
DWM: Patch for spacing over and under letters and such
DWM: Look into better/alternative fonts


### EXPANSIONS

DWM: Add more layouts


### LOW-PRIO BUGFIXES

SXHKD: Why are the monitor brightness keys not registering - not even in xev
RANGER: Understand what is needed to get image previews working - w3m is nope?


### DEPRIORITISIED

RANGER: Figure out how to get image previews
